scarf down text from teams to a file

dependencies:

sudo snap install chromium-chromedriver

todo:
allow connection to an already connected chrome browser. Is it possible?
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8344776/can-selenium-interact-with-an-existing-browser-session

for now it can manually connect to a started selenium session by editing the session url/id in the code.
This saves the trouble of authentication, etc. while debugging.

todo:
don't dump until you trigger with a keystroke

done: put on github

todo: add undetected-chromedriver (as a matter of principle because microsoft is likely to prevent scraping eventually)
