# Selenium Teams Scraper

This Python script uses Selenium to automate interactions with Microsoft Teams. It can be configured to either launch a new Chrome instance or connect to an existing one, allowing for easier debugging and interaction with an already logged-in session.

The script waits for a user to press the `ENTER` key before it proceeds to scrape chat content, giving you full control over the timing. It securely manages your credentials using a `.env` file and uses `undetected-chromedriver` to appear more like a regular user, reducing the chances of being blocked.

## ‚ú® Features

  * **Secure Credential Management**: Loads email and password from a `.env` file instead of hardcoding them in the script.
  * **Two Launch Modes**:
    1.  **New Browser**: Launches a new, clean instance of Chrome for the automation.
    2.  **Connect to Existing Browser**: Attaches to an already running Chrome instance (requires launching Chrome with a remote debugging port).
  * **Manual Trigger**: Waits for the user to press the `ENTER` key before initiating the scraping logic, giving you time to navigate to the correct chat or channel.
  * **Stealth Operations**: Uses `undetected-chromedriver` to avoid bot detection.
  * **Robust Automation**: Employs explicit waits to handle page load times gracefully, preventing common script failures.
  * **Organized Output**: Saves the scraped chat content to a timestamped text file (e.g., `teams_chat_2025-07-16_15-30-05.txt`).

## üìã Prerequisites

  * Python 3.8+
  * Google Chrome browser installed.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Configuration

Follow these steps to set up the project environment and configure your credentials.

**1. Clone the Repository**
Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/QuiteUncertain/selenium_teams.git
cd selenium_teams
```

**2. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)**
It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to keep project dependencies isolated.

```bash
# For Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# For macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

**3. Install Dependencies**
Install all the required Python packages from the `requirements.txt` file.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**4. Create the Configuration File**
Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project directory. This file will store your Microsoft Teams credentials securely.

Your `.env` file should look like this:

```
# .env file
TEAMS_EMAIL="your-email@example.com"
TEAMS_PASSWORD="your_password_here"
```

**Important**: The included `.gitignore` file is configured to ignore the `.env` file, so your credentials will not be accidentally committed to version control.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

You can run the script in two primary modes.

### Mode 1: Launch a New Browser Instance (Default)

This mode will open a fresh Chrome window and attempt to log in using the credentials from your `.env` file.

To run in this mode, simply execute the script:

```bash
python selenium_teams.py
```

### Mode 2: Connect to an Existing Chrome Session

This mode is useful for development or if you are already logged into Teams. It allows the script to take control of a Chrome tab you already have open, bypassing the login process.

**Step 1: Launch Chrome with Remote Debugging**
You must first close all running instances of Google Chrome. Then, launch it from your terminal with a special flag.

  * **On Windows (using Command Prompt):**

    ```cmd
    "C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe" --remote-debugging-port=9222
    ```

  * **On macOS (using Terminal):**

    ```bash
    /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --remote-debugging-port=9222
    ```

  * **On Linux (using Terminal):**

    ```bash
    google-chrome --remote-debugging-port=9222
    ```

After running this command, open Teams in your browser and navigate to the desired page.

**Step 2: Run the Python Script with the `--connect` Flag**
Open a new terminal, navigate to the project directory, and run the script with the `--connect` flag:

```bash
python selenium_teams.py --connect
```

### The Scraping Process

1.  After the script launches (in either mode), it will print:
    `‚úÖ Browser is ready. Navigate to the desired chat and press ENTER to start scraping...`
2.  At this point, manually navigate within the Teams web interface to the chat you want to scrape.
3.  Once ready, press the `ENTER` key in the terminal where the script is running.
4.  The script will then scrape the visible chat content and save it to a timestamped `.txt` file in the project directory.
